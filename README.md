## My process
The first thing to think of was: **Mobile Devices**. In this project wasn't necessary use more than one CSS file and neither CSS Flexbox or CSS Grid. Following the design file and a little bit of my wishes, this project was made in 1 hour and 9 minutes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I made a course with Gustavo Guanabara, a brazilian teacher, a course of HTML5 and CSS. I wanted to make this project like a way of practice all that i learned with him, and this is just the first project.

### Continued development

In future projects, i want to work in CSS Flex and Grid, CSS Position and train more design concepts. And i want to learn JavaScript, React and another technologies to work with Frontend Development.
